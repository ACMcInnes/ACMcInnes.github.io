                Hi, my name is Andrew, I'm a Developer Support Specialist for an Australian based e-commerce platform.
                My day to day includes onboarding developers who wish to built out add-ons or API solutions, to running through
                our frontend templating language.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not working with our Developer Partners I'm improving and building out our library of online store 'themes' -
                built on a combination of Bootstrap, jQuery, and general HTML/CSS/JavaScript. With a passion for Frontend Development work,
                this extends into my free time where I am always looking for an opportunity to hone my Web Development skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most recently I've started looking into React, a component based JavaScript framework that allows page layouts to be quickly built -
                assuming you've correctly broken down all your components to be as re-usable as possible.

                    <p>REACT SANDBOX</p>
                    <p>
                        I decided to learn React over other JavaScript frameworks because of it's popularity
                        and continued improvements over the years. Recent additions such as Hooks has greating improved
                        the dynamic components that React and other JavaScript frameworks are known for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is still a work in progress but the end goal is to create a responsive and fun experience for
                        any visitors. Collecting data supplied and rendering that in exciting ways. The sandbox also utilises
                        a dark mode toggle which takes the visitors display preference into account on first visit.

                    <p>CONDOR MIGRATION AGENCY</p>
                    <p>
                        I have recently finished working on a Wordpress site for a local Migration Agency. The company
                        went through a rebranding and wanted a fresh new website to reflect this. Building the site on Wordpress
                        had its advantages. I was quickly able to add content to the site, then decide on a theme that worked well
                        with the clients needs. A focus on testimonials with an impression of a skilled and competent team was to be
                        the focus, as well as being easily contactable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using Wordpress I was able to add features through the use of plug ins, even add or edit custom HTML & CSS through
                        the use of a child theme that I created and linked to the main parent theme.

                        After university I have kept busy creating websites and graphics for fun, while doing some
                        casual work maintaining websites for people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have created a few sites showing my work, the first is a mock store front using PHP
                        and MySQL to grab items from a file, load them to a database then grab items depending on
                        the users search queries. All the calls to the server are done with AJAX so the page doesn't
                        have to reload to show the search results. The website is fully functional up to the checkout
                        process. I'm still working on the shopping cart, at the moment you can add items or drop the entire
                        cart. From there dropping individual items, adding quantities and a mock payment screen are planned
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The second website I have made is a mock travel agency, built on Bootstrap 4. Using a framework such
                        as Bootstrap or Material Design can greatly improve website creation. One draw back though is that using
                        the default CSS means your website will look like a copy of any other website built off the framework.
                        Therefor it can always benefit from some custom CSS styling as well, to make it stand out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The travel website uses a number of bootstrap components such as the carousel and card grids to easily
                        position and display content.

                    <p>
                        This website showcases some of my graphic design work from a course at university. First I made
                        graphical representations of facts from the Harper's Magazine Index. These facts would include ridiculous
                        numbers that are hard for the brain to visualise, by simplifying the number and comparing it to something
                        most people are familiar with makes the fact far easier to understand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next an Infographic of a complex process. Designed to be printed out, this Infographic showcases
                        different sci-fi ships and how they are able to fly through space faster than lightspeed.
                        Finally I created a magazine showcasing all the graphics that were created for the course, as well
                        as some of my inspirations and interests.

            <h4 class="pad-left">Floor Based Navigation System (Final Year Project) - 2016</h4>
            <p>
                For our final year project we were tasked with creating a system that took input from
                a physical interaction, such as touch or motion. Our team decided to solve the issue of
                navigating around an inclosed space such as a shopping centre or town square.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone has seen those kiosks with the touch screens and the map, search a store or place
                and get instructions which you either have to remember or take a picture of, what if the
                system could guide you the rest of the way?
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the premise behind our project, a floor based information display that a user could
                walk onto, select their destination by tapping their foot on it, and be guided to their location
                through a physical guide such as LED light tracks or through their phone by scanning a QR code.
            </p>
            <p>
                As well as planning and testing, my main responsibility for this project was creating the tracking
                software that would path find between the points of interest we had chosen.

            <h4 class="pad-left">Augmented Reality Obstacle Course/Card Game - 2015</h4>
            <p>
                For this project we were required to create an Augmented Reality Experience, meaning when you launched
                the application and viewed your surroundings through the phone camera, 3D objects will be overlaid onto
                the video for you to interact with.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was split into two parts, initial concept - were our team came up with the initial experience and
                started to implement basic functionality. My first project was a card game that would display a 3D model
                of the card character on screen, when the camera picked up the physical card.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part was completing a project another team had already started. For this part our team was
                to complete an Augmented Reality Obstacle Course, were users would have a physical path to follow while
                solving or avoiding obstacles on their phone camera.

            <h4 class="pad-left">Online Roleplaying Game - 2014</h4>
            <p>
                One of the first major projects I was part of, the whole class (~100 students) was tasked with creating
                an online computer game. We were split into teams to work on seperate parts of the application, all the
                code was managed on GitHub, so each team would fork their own version, work on their part, then integrate
                back into the main code base. Ironing out bugs with other teams and trying not to break everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Team was responsible for creating a player safehouse, my part was creating the graphical assets
                and sprites that would be displayed on screen when the player entered the house.
